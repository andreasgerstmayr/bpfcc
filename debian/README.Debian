Starting with version 0.2.0-2, all binary files
have been renamed to $filename-bpfcc suffix.

For example: execsnoop => execsnoop-bpfcc

Similarly, the manpages have been renamed. This is done to accommodate
users who would like to use perf-tools-unstable, parallelly with the
eBPF Compiler Collection Tools from the bpfcc package.

Both upstreams work closely on the projects, thus the common names.
